      We went over lots of things this intersession.The first few days were spend making a website about the current virus going around.The next couple of days were spent making a website about stress reduction.The next day we spent learning about paychecks and salarie.Then we spent one day making a page about a media event that influenced us.Our last full website was following the money theme by requiring us to make a site about how we would budget after highschool during a post-apcalyptic world. The last day was spent making this compilation site.
